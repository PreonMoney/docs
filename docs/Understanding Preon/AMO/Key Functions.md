# Key Functions of the Preon AMO

## Peg Stability:

The AMO autonomously mints and burns $STAR based on supply-demand imbalances. These actions are carefully designed to maintain the $STAR peg. The closed-system approach ensures that every $USDC in circulation corresponds **proportionally** to the total $STAR minted, and any excess $STAR is **always** burned during rebalancing to maintain full collateralization.

## Liquidity Deployment:

The AMO manages the $USDC-$STAR liquidity pool (LP) by depositing $USDC and $STAR in balanced proportions. The minted $STAR follows a programmatic schedule, and when $STAR is sold back for $USDC, the protocol burns the proportional amount of $STAR during rebalancing to ensure nothing unbacked leaves the system.
