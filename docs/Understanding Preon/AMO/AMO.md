## Automated Market Operations for STAR

Preon's Automated Market Operations Controller (AMO) for STAR is a smart contract designed to autonomously execute predefined monetary policies. The AMO **enhances peg stability**, **optimizes capital efficiency**, and ensures transparency within the STAR ecosystem. Operating within a closed system, the AMO performs dynamic monetary operations **without negatively** impacting the stability or solvency of STAR.  STAR remains over-collateralized as all excess STAR is burned, ensuring that no unbacked STAR ever leaves the contained system.

For transparency purposes, all AMOs are publicly displayed on our dashboard: https://app.preon.finance/dashboard
