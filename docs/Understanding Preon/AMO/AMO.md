## Automated Market Operations for $STAR


Preon introduces the Automated Market Operations Controller (AMO) for $STAR, a smart contract designed to autonomously execute predefined monetary policies. The AMO **enhances peg stability**, **optimizes capital efficiency**, and ensures transparency within the $STAR ecosystem. Operating within a closed system, the AMO performs dynamic monetary operations **without negatively** impacting the peg, while keeping the protocol 100% collateralized at all times. Importantly, any excess $STAR is burned, ensuring that no unbacked $STAR ever leaves the contained system.

For transparency purposes, all AMOs are publicly displayed on our dashboard: https://app.preon.finance/dashboard
